   synopsys:
      The role of this script is to start tmux automatically on login session
      (the  one  which involves  logging in  with credentials),  to attach to
      existing tmux session if one already exists,  and to prevent accidental
      exiting  from tmux  (later can happen  if we unintentionally close last
      "panel" in tmux, for example by exiting shell with CTRL+D).
      
      By attaching to existing tmux session, we achieve that only one session
      is  running per user login.  Aka.  each new ssh to host will disconnect
      active  ssh  session  (by stealing tmux session),  while preserving all
      what is running in current session.  Same rule applies to console login
      session, which will steal any active tmux session (being ssh or console
      session).  Basically only one  tmux login session can exist, and conse-
      quentially only one login session.


   ending session:
      When  ltmux  is  enabled,  session has to be exited using following key
      combinations (called "exit keys"):

         prefix q   - quit session preserving current
                      layout and active processes

         prefix x   - kill  all active  processes and 
                      destroy current tmux session

      Above "exit keys" combination is defined in .tmux.config file. It can
      be freely modified by user, but the code itself should be preserved.

      If  for any  reason above  keys stop  working, session can be exited by
      ending tmux sessions 3 times in prediod of 10 seconds or less (the ea-
      siest way to achieve this is to press CTRL+D 3 times, in last existing
      pane).


   enabling/disabling:
      This  script  is  run  from  login scripts,  which in  turn are sourced
      during  login  process.  Which  scripts  is  involved depends on  shell
      (bash/zsh)  and  present  files  (not all rc files have to be present).
      If no file is present in user's home directory one is created.
      
      To enable/disable ltmux on login run:
      
          ltmux {enable|disable}

      [32mNOTE:
         It  is  only possible  to  enable/disable ltmux for bash & zsh login
         shell.


   default config file:
      We can also "install" default tmux config file, issuing:
      
          ltmux config install
      
      If  tmux  config file  (.tmux.conf)  already exists,  and it is not the
      ltmux's config file, it will be preserved as ".tmux.conf.ORG",  and can
      be restored issuing:
      
         ltmux config remove
      
      "config install" can be run multiple times, but only one copy of
      ".tmux.conf.ORG" will be preserved.

      You  can  freealy  edit  config file,  but preserve commented out lines
      identifying it as default ltmux config file.
